      I've been baking as long as I can remember. Making pretty but tasty food
      is really fun and seeing the end result makes the hard work worth it.
      Recently my favourite items to make have been macarons and buttercream
      flowers for cakes. In the past I've made treats such as:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Donuts</li>
      <li>Cupcakes</li>
      <li>
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Croquembouche" target="_blank"
          >Croquembouches</a
        >
      </li>
      <li>Decorated Sugar Cookies</li>
      <li>and Gelatin Flowers!</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Swimming</h2>

      In the third grade I started precompetitive artistic swimming with one of
      my best friends at
      <a href="https://excelartisticswim.com/" target="_blank">
        Excel Artistic Swimming</a
      >. I could barely swim at that point but I got so much better so quickly!
      Joining that eventually led me to competitive artistic swimming. This left
      me with the abilities to become a swim instructor and a lifeguard.
      Swimming is the focus of my favourite memories! There are so many, but
      here are some of my favourites:
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>Away competitions with my best friends</li>
      <li>Getting my first award and standing at the podium</li>
      <li>Starting my first job as a swim instructor</li>
    </ol>

      My dad has always been very into the outdoors. At least once a year he
      goes on a back country camping trip and we usually go front country
      camping at least once a summer. My favourite campground is
      <a
        href="https://www.albertaparks.ca/parks/central/miquelon-lake-pp/information-facilities/camping/miquelon-lake/"
        target="_blank"
        >Miquelon Lake Provincial Park</a
      >. While the lake is unswimmable due to the high salinity, it's the
      campground we've been going to since I was little. They had all kinds of
      activities like interactive plays, pond-dipping kits, and more that I
      loved when I was younger.
